SUBJECT: Page speed opportunity for Bombas

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BODY:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi there,

I took a look at Bombas and ran some performance tests. I noticed your homepage is loading slower than ideal - The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) for the desktop homepage is 4984ms, which is significantly slower than the recommended threshold of 2500ms. This indicates a poor loading experience for the main content, potentially leading to user frustration and higher bounce rates. Specifically, performance metrics: desktop: lcp: 4984ms (slow)

Slow load times can significantly impact both conversions and search rankings. Studies show that each second of delay can reduce conversions by 7%.

There are usually some quick optimizations that can make a noticeable difference.

Would you be interested in a brief overview of what could be improved?

Best regards,
