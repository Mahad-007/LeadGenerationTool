# Mandatory Code Change Audit Protocol

All code changes must follow this sequence:

1. Implement the requested change.
2. Critically evaluate the change for correctness, edge cases, security, and maintainability.
3. Audit the code for regressions or architectural issues.
4. Revise the code based on the audit.
5. Perform a final verification pass.

Rules:
- This protocol is mandatory.
- The final response must include a brief Audit Summary.
- If no issues are found, the reason must be explicitly stated.
